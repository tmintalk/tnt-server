## Implementation
### Post
After creating a table consisting of date, item, price, about, description, and imageUrl, a post is generated by sending a POST request with the parameter in the body while logging in. In addition, a list of posts is delivered to show the posts on the feed.

- GET `/posts`
- POST `/posts`

### Question & Answer
Provide service to more easily post in the service by suggesting questions. If you answer the proposed question while logging in, you will be connected to the user.

- GET `/questions`
- POST `/`
- POST `/answer/:questionId`

### Like

- POST `/likes/:postId`
- DELETE `/likes/:postId`

### Chatting
The chat function was implemented so that direct interaction could occur after viewing the other person's post. Using socket, chat room creation, chat room confirmation, and chat transmission were implemented.

- GET `/chat/allMessages`
- GET `/chat/:roomId/users`
- GET `/chat/:roomId/messages`
- GEt `/chat/:name/readCnt`

### Image Upload
Since images are needed for profile photos and post photos, APIs were created to store images in AWS' S3 image cloud. Receive the image, save it, and return the uri.

- POST `/uploads`
- POST `/uploads/post`

### Join & Login
The password was hashed, and after signing up and logging in, JWToken was used to check whether the API was logged in if it was necessary to use the API in the login state.

- GET `/auth/me`
- POST `/auth/join`
- POST `/auth/login`
